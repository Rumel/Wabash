# Wabash

Wabash is a little utility to grab all of your liked threads off
of Reddit. It then uses this information to generate a sorted list
of your most upvoted subreddits. This is written to a 'results.csv'
file.

### Dependencies

Wabash relies on the getpass and requests library. They can be installed
via:

`pip install getpass`

`pip install requests`
